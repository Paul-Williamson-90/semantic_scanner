If the proposed Transfer includes assets not related to the operation of the Franchise, we may purchase only the assets related to the operation of the Franchise or may also purchase the other assets (Page 42)

You must immediately notify us of any changes in the terms of an offer. (Page 42)

Any material change in the terms of an offer before closing will make it a new offer, revoking any previous approval or previously made election to purchase and giving us a new right of first refusal effective as of the day we receive formal notice of a material change in the terms. (Page 42)

Any later proposal to complete that proposed Transfer will be deemed a new offer, giving us a new right of approval and right of first refusal effective as of the day we receive formal notice of the new (or continuing) proposal. (Page 42)

We will not exercise a right of first refusal with respect to a proposed Transfer of less than a controlling interest to a member of a Principal Owner‚Äôs immediate family or to your key employees. (Page 42)

Upon the termination or expiration of the Franchise, we will have the option, but not the obligation, exercisable for thirty (30) days upon written notice to you, to purchase at fair market value all of the assets of the Franchise, including all approved equipment, fixtures, furniture and signs and all supplies, materials, and other items imprinted with any Mark, and to take an assignment of the lease for the Premises and any other lease or concession agreement necessary for the operation of the Franchise.
