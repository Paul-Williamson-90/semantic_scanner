"  (c) Renewal Agreement; Releases. Should you choose to renew the Franchise, you must provide us with written notice of that intent no earlier than two (2) years and no later than one (1) year before the expiration of the Initial Term. To renew the Franchise, the Company, you and your Principal Owners must execute the form of Franchise Agreement and any ancillary agreements we are then customarily using in the grant or renewal of franchises for the operation of The Joint Corp. Location Franchises (with appropriate modifications to reflect the fact that the agreement relates to the grant of a renewal franchise), except that no initial franchise fee will be payable upon renewal of the Franchise. However, you must pay to us a renewal fee equal to 25% of our then-current initial franchise fee for Start-up Locations. You and your Principal Owners and your and their spouses must also execute general releases, in a form satisfactory to us, of any and all claims against us and our affiliates, and our and their respective owners, officers, directors, employees, and agents.   2.7 Personal Guaranty by Principal Owners; Reference to Exhibit 2.   Each of the Principal Owners and their spouses (where applicable), will be required to execute a personal guaranty (the ""Guaranty""), guaranteeing the Franchise's liabilities and obligations to the Company.

Our review and approval process may take up to thirty (30) days, so we recommend you submit your proposed site to us within one hundred fifty (150) days of the Agreement Date. You must submit to us, in the form we specify, a description of the site and such other information or materials as we may reasonably require. We will not unreasonably withhold approval of a site that meets our standards for general location and neighborhood, traffic patterns, parking size, layout and other physical characteristics, for The Joint Corp. Location franchises. Our approval of a site shall not constitute, nor be deemed, a judgment as to the likelihood of success of a The Joint Corp. Location at such location, or a judgment as to the relative desirability of such location in comparison to other locations. If you fail to identify a mutually-agreeable site within the aforementioned six (6) month period, we may terminate this Agreement.   (b) Once we have approved the proposed site of the Premises for your Franchise, you must obtain lawful possession of the Premises through lease or purchase within thirty (30) days of our approval of the Premises. You agree that you will not execute a lease without our advance written approval of the lease terms. The lease for the Premises must include the Addendum to Lease, attached hereto as Exhibit 3, permitting us to take possession of the Premises under certain conditions if this Agreement is terminated or if you violate the terms of the lease.
