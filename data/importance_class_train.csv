Consistent with other communications                envisioned during the Term of the Agreement, such mailings will                be branded Excite@Home but will alert Program Members that this                Agreement is to be terminated, the Co-Branded Application will  continue with e-centives branding, and Program Members will                continue as a participant in the e-centives service unless they                explicitly opt out.  The content and copy of such emails shall be                mutually agreed upon.            ii)  The first email will be exclusive to e-centives (i.e., it will                not mention similar services from Excite@Home or other third                parties) and will alert Program Members of the continuation of                the e-centives service directly from e-centives.

Excite@Home shall not promote competing services in such contact                or otherwise discourage Program Members from continuing to use                the e-centives service as provided directly by e-centives.            iii) The second email will not be exclusive to e-centives. It will                include the same e-centives alerts as in the first email, but may                offer a replacement Excite@Home service and a notification that                the Program Member will remain in such an Excite@Home-provided                service unless they specifically opt-out.

Transporter reserves the right to require Shipper to install or cause platform owners to install in accordance with applicable API and ASTM (American Society for Testing Materials) standards metering and meter proving equipment capable of continuous custody measurement, and devices for continuous proportional to-flow sampling of the Crude Petroleum.   5.6 If Crude Petroleum to be delivered to Transporter is produced at some distance from the Transporter's facilities and Transporter does not elect to provide a connection directly to the production platform where it is produced, Shipper may furnish, or cause to be furnished, free of cost to Transporter, the connecting pipeline required to deliver such Shipper's Crude Petroleum to the location designated by Transporter. If such location is on another producer's platform, all arrangement for installing the connecting pipeline or other required equipment or facilities on such platform shall be the sole responsibility of the Shipper.   5.7 At Transporter's request, Shipper will allow, or cause the platform owner(s) to allow, Transporter to place, operate, repair and maintain riser piping, scraper traps, valves, surveillance equipment, and any other equipment deemed by Transporter to be needed for the safe and efficient operation of the Gathering System.

The parties agree that there will be regular merchandising meetings between the parties to discuss  sales performance, fashion, brand and retail trends, and initiatives. It is contemplated that such meetings shall take place no less  than once per month during the first year of the Term and then no less than quarterly thereafter.     (b) The parties agree that the Merchandise mix as of the Effective Date for each of the Websites and Catalogs is  an approved baseline of categories and the general mix of Merchandise and that there will be no material deviations from such mix  without the mutual agreement of Client and EFS, provided however that (i) EFS shall use commercially reasonable efforts to work  with Client to align the merchandising of the Bunny Shop with that of Client's retail stores and (ii) EFS shall collaborate with Client  to reduce the amount of unbranded (i.e., non-Playboy branded) apparel from its current levels (currently ***** of all apparel and  ***** of the total Merchandise mix), which shall in no event comprise more than ***** of EFS' total Merchandise mix. For the  avoidance of doubt, Merchandise shall not include ticket sales to Client-sponsored or other events. For purposes of this  Agreement, the term ""branded Merchandise"" shall refer to Merchandise which contains or references any of the Playboy Marks  or is otherwise branded or labeled with a Playboy Mark, and the term ""unbranded Merchandise"" shall refer to Merchandise  which does not contain or make reference to any of the Playboy Marks.     (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 2.1, if Client determines in its sole discretion that certain  Merchandise must be removed or altered for legal reasons, EFS shall promptly take such action required by Client. If Client  requests that EFS change or discontinue any Merchandise for reasons other than legal, Client will provide EFS with sufficient  notice and a reasonable sell-off period to minimize any disruption to the Playboy Commerce Business and EFS shall comply. In  the event that the Merchandise required to be removed is a current item being sold and such removal results in an actual material  impact on revenues or Merchandise Gross Margin as demonstrated by EFS, EFS and Client will work together to agree on an  equitable adjustment to the Minimum Royalty.     2.2. Purchase and Use of Existing Inventory. EFS will purchase from Client all existing product inventory of Merchandise  held by or on behalf of Client in connection with the Playboy Commerce Business, including, but not limited to, back issues of  PLAYBOY Magazine held by Client as of forty-five (45) days after as of the Effective Date hereof, as determined by Client  (collectively, the ""Client Inventory""), as set forth in Section 6.6.

For such orders, EFS shall pay the vendor in full, with such payments to be made directly to each vendor in accordance  with such vendor's payment terms, and therefore, the Merchandise purchased in connection with March 1, 2008 orders shall not  be subject to the discount for Client Inventory set forth in Section 6.6.     2.4.

"AT&T and its auditors (including internal audit staff and external auditors) and governmental authorities shall have the right to review such records (“AT&T Audits”) held and created by Vendor, to verify the following:  (i) the accuracy of Vendor’s invoices and AT&T’s payment obligations hereunder;  (ii) that the Work charged for was actually performed;  (iii) that the Services have been and are being provided in accordance with this Agreement;  (iv) the integrity of Vendor’s systems that process, store, support, maintain, and transmit AT&T data;  (v) Vendor’s records relating to the performance of Vendor’s Subcontractors with respect to any portion of the Services; and  (vi) that Vendor and its Subcontractors are complying with Section 3.6 hereof. When the FirstNet Authority or other governmental authority requests to review Vendor’s records, AT&T and its auditors will review these records first if the FirstNet Authority or other governmental authority permits such review, and provide the records to the requesting governmental authority; provided, however, the FirstNet Authority and other governmental authorities retain the right to perform audits independent of AT&T. Subject to Subsection (g) below, Vendor shall provide and shall require that its Subcontractors provide to AT&T, its auditors (including internal audit staff and external auditors), and governmental authorities access at all reasonable times to:  (i) any facility at which the Services or any portion thereof are being performed;  (ii) systems and assets used to provide the Services or any portion thereof;  (iii) Vendor employees and Subcontractor employees providing the Services or any portion thereof; and  (iv) all Vendor and Subcontractor records, including financial records relating to the invoices and payment obligations and supporting documentation, pertaining to the Services. The scope of AT&T Audits shall also include:  (i) practices and procedures used in performing the Services;  (ii) systems, communications and information technology used in performing the Services;  (iii) general controls and security practices and procedures;  (iv) supporting information and calculations regarding invoices and compliance with service requirements;  (v) quality initiatives and quality assurance; and  (vi) compliance with the terms of this Agreement. AT&T’s access to the records and other supporting documentation shall include the right to inspect and photocopy Vendor’s documentation and the documentation of its Subcontractors as provided to Vendor, and the right to retain copies thereof outside of their physical location with appropriate safeguards, if such retention is deemed reasonably necessary by AT&T and only to the extent that all such records are maintained by AT&T in accordance with Section 3.16 hereof. AT&T Audits may be conducted once a year (or more frequently if requested by governmental authorities who regulate AT&T’s business, if required by applicable Law or if auditors require follow-up access to complete audit inquiries or if an audit uncovers any problems or deficiencies), upon at least ten (10) business days advance notice (unless otherwise mandated by Law) and during business hours. Vendor will cooperate, and will ensure that its Subcontractors cooperate, in the AT&T Audits, and will make the information reasonably required to conduct the AT&T Audits available on a timely basis. Vendor will provide AT&T, at AT&T’s request and cost, with paper and electronic copies of documents and information reasonably necessary to verify Vendor’s compliance with this Agreement. With respect to AT&T requests for audits or inspections of Vendor’s Subcontractors, the following applies:  (i) If Vendor’s agreement with its applicable Subcontractor permits an AT&T Audit, AT&T shall be permitted to conduct such audit directly or through a third party representative. Vendor shall work with AT&T in facilitating the Subcontractor’s cooperation for an expeditious and thorough audit or inspection.  (ii) If Vendor’s contract with its applicable Subcontractor precludes AT&T from directly conducting an audit or inspection, Vendor shall use reasonable best efforts to enable AT&T to perform an audit of the Subcontractor with Vendor coordinating the audit process. Failing those efforts, Vendor shall, upon AT&T’s request and at AT&T’s expense, conduct the audit or inspection on behalf of AT&T, subject to terms agreed to by Vendor and AT&T for the Subcontractor audit, such as areas to be audited, applicable fees, and the timeframe for reporting audit results to AT&T. If AT&T’s request for a Vendor audit or inspection arises from, in AT&T’s good faith opinion, materially or consistently deficient Service provided by the Subcontractor under AT&T’s account, and the audit in both Parties’ opinions confirms such deficiencies, Vendor shall not charge AT&T a fee for the Vendor’s audit of its Subcontractor.  (iii) If Vendor’s contract with its applicable Subcontractor does not allow Vendor access to the facilities and systems of Subcontractor required to conduct the audit described in Subsection (b) above, then Vendor shall provide a list of such Subcontractors and the services being provided by such Subcontractor to AT&T for its review. To the extent AT&T deems it reasonably necessary to require such access, then Vendor will renegotiate its contract with the applicable Subcontractor in order to obtain the audit rights described in Subsection (b) above. Failing those efforts, Vendor shall, upon AT&T’s request and at AT&T’s expense, conduct the audit or inspection on behalf of AT&T, subject to terms agreed to by Vendor and AT&T for the Subcontractor audit, such as areas to be audited, applicable fees, and the timeframe for reporting audit results to AT&T AT&T may inspect and inventory the material furnished by AT&T under this Agreement during Vendor’s normal business hours. Prior to Location Acceptance, Vendor shall provide AT&T escorted access to the premises wherein all such material is located and, following Location Acceptance, AT&T shall have access to the premises wherein all such material is located pursuant to the terms of the Master License Agreement and the applicable Site License thereunder or any third party Tower Lease, as applicable.
