(Page 39)

Subject to Subsection (g) below, Vendor shall provide and shall require that its Subcontractors provide to AT&T, its auditors (including internal audit staff and external auditors), and governmental authorities access at all reasonable times to: 

(i) any facility at which the Services or any portion thereof are being performed; 

(ii) systems and assets used to provide the Services or any portion thereof;

(i) If Vendor’s agreement with its applicable Subcontractor permits an AT&T Audit, AT&T shall be permitted to conduct such audit directly or through a third party representative. Vendor shall work with AT&T in facilitating the Subcontractor’s cooperation for an expeditious and thorough audit or inspection. 

(ii) If Vendor’s contract with its applicable Subcontractor precludes AT&T from directly conducting an audit or inspection, Vendor shall use reasonable best efforts to enable AT&T to perform an audit of the Subcontractor with Vendor coordinating the audit process. Failing those efforts, Vendor shall, upon AT&T’s request and at AT&T’s expense, conduct the audit or inspection on behalf of AT&T, subject to terms agreed to by Vendor and AT&T for the Subcontractor audit, such as areas to be audited, applicable fees, and the timeframe for reporting audit results to AT&T. If AT&T’s request for a Vendor audit or inspection arises from, in AT&T’s good faith opinion, materially or consistently deficient Service provided by the Subcontractor under AT&T’s account, and the audit in both Parties’ opinions confirms such deficiencies, Vendor shall not charge AT&T a fee for the Vendor’s audit of its Subcontractor. 

(iii) If Vendor’s contract with its applicable Subcontractor does not allow Vendor access to the facilities and systems of Subcontractor required to conduct the audit described in Subsection (b) above, then Vendor shall provide a list of such Subcontractors and the services being provided by such Subcontractor to AT&T for its review. To the extent AT&T deems it reasonably necessary to require such access, then Vendor will renegotiate its contract with the applicable Subcontractor in order to obtain the audit rights described in Subsection (b) above.

Failing those efforts, Vendor shall, upon AT&T’s request and at AT&T’s expense, conduct the audit or inspection on behalf of AT&T, subject to terms agreed to by Vendor and AT&T for the Subcontractor audit, such as areas to be audited, applicable fees, and the timeframe for reporting audit results to AT&T (Page 41)

In the event that the Minimum Royalty is met in any applicable Year, (i) EFS shall not be permitted to carry  over any overages into the next Year and (ii) EFS will not be eligible for any refund from any Minimum Royalty or Royalty  previously owed or paid to Client. (Page 17)

For the avoidance of  doubt, the Minimum Royalty is a minimum net sum from which no taxes or charges of any sort may be deducted. (Page 17)

Upon termination of this Agreement for reasons other than a           relationship with an Excite@Home Named Competitor under Section           16.a.v., the parties will communicate with Program Members as follows:

Consistent with other communications                envisioned during the Term of the Agreement, such mailings will                be branded Excite@Home but will alert Program Members that this                Agreement is to be terminated, the Co-Branded Application will <omitted>  continue with e-centives branding, and Program Members will                continue as a participant in the e-centives service unless they                explicitly opt out.  The content and copy of such emails shall be                mutually agreed upon. 

          ii)  The first email will be exclusive to e-centives (i.e., it will                not mention similar services from Excite@Home or other third                parties) and will alert Program Members of the continuation of                the e-centives service directly from e-centives. Program Members                shall be further alerted that their membership in the e-centives                service shall continue unless they explicitly opt-out.                Excite@Home shall not promote competing services in such contact                or otherwise discourage Program Members from continuing to use                the e-centives service as provided directly by e-centives. 

          iii) The second email will not be exclusive to e-centives. It will                include the same e-centives alerts as in the first email, but may                offer a replacement Excite@Home service and a notification that                the Program Member will remain in such an Excite@Home-provided                service unless they specifically opt-out. Excite@Home shall not                discourage Program Members from continuing to use the e-centives                service directly from e-centives, but may offer an additional                choice. It is conceivable that any one end user customer could                use both services.

Regardless of the basis on which Customer is entitled to claim damages from IBM (including fundamental breach, negligence, misrepresentation, or other contract or tort claim), IBM is liable for no more than: indemnification payments as provided in Section 8.1; damages for bodily injury (including death) and damage to real property and tangible personal property; and the amount of any other actual direct damages, up to the greater of $100,000 or the charges paid by Customer to IBM for the Services in the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the accrual of the first claim related to the Services. (Page 6)

It is the cumulative maximum for which IBM and its Affiliates and Subcontractors are collectively responsible. (Page 6)

In no event will either party be liable to the other for special, incidental, or indirect damages or for any consequential damages (including lost profits or savings), even if they are informed of the possibility; provided that this Section 10.0 does not apply to Customer’s failure to pay any amounts owing to IBM under this Agreement (including amounts owing for Services that would have been rendered but for Customer’s breach of this Agreement). (Page 6)

If such modification has a material adverse effect on the Customer’s use of the Services and provided such modification is not required by law, regulation, or similar governmental action, or a ruling by a court of competent jurisdiction, Customer’s sole remedy is to terminate this Agreement without the payment of termination charges provided Customer gives IBM notice of its intent to terminate within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such modification. (Page 8)

Neither party will bring a legal action related to this Agreement more than two years after the cause of action accrued. (Page 9)

Customer agrees that its sole remedy for IBM’s failure to meet an SLA Target Percentage is the Availability Credit as provided in this Attachment. (Page 25)",Cap on Liability
